# VideoPoliceBot
A simple bot for Discord

The bot works as follows:

-It finds all the voice channels on a server, then it starts iterating through all the members of each channel;
-It looks if a user has their webcamera on, if yes it adds it to a counter, if no it adds it to a separate counter (it also differentiates between bots and real users);
-If the ratio of camera_users/no_camera_users is greater or equal than a certain value, then it a message to all the users without the camera on, telling them they have a minute to turn it on, or they will be disconnected.
-After a minute passes, the bot checks if any of the users without a webcamera have turned it on and sends them a message and it also disconnects the one who haven't turned their cameras on;
-Lastly, the bot moves on to the next voice channel and when it's done it waits for 5 minutes, then it goes through each channel again.

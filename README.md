# Intro

VideoPoliceBot is a Discord Bot made by me with a pretty simple functionaly, but I ended up adding more stuff and plan to keep doing it for a while.
It's functionalities up to now are the following:

# 1. Webcam surveillance for voice channels

PoliceBot looks for any voice channels where there are users with their webcams on. If half + 1 of those users has their webcams on, the bot will send a private message to each of those with their webcams off.

After receiving this message, the user has 15 seconds to turn their camera on, if not they will be disconnected from the channel and also receive another message from the bot.

# 2. Ciocoflenderposting

-It has a 5% chance to post an image right after anyone sends a message in any chat channel
# 3. Emoji Counter

-It keeps track of how many times each emoji has been used by each member of the server using a SQLite database. Any user can see a top of up to 15 most used emojis for any user of the server.
